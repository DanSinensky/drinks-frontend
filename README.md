# DrinkHub Web Application


# Introduction
    This repository is a fully built out website using React. For this project, we utilized the Cocktail Database ()to list out a number of popular drinks, and how to make them. We also built out a backend that allows a user to be created and interact with the site. A user can sign up, pin their favorite drinks to the favorites page, create custom favorites unique to their account, and edit and delete those custom drinks.

        -Mongoose

# Usage
